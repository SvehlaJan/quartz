- it's expected that every platform in the Metaverse will want to own user's identity
- will the identities interoperate?
- will the platforms allow standards such as [Decentralised identity](Decentralised%20identity.md)?
- will the platforms allow anonymous access? will they require a public social media account?

- how will the identity be verified? will users be able to verify identity of other users? [Verification methods](Verification%20methods.md)
	- avatars with fake identities might be used for [Social engineering attacks](Social%20engineering%20attacks.md)
