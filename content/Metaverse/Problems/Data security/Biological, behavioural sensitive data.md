title: "Biological, behavioural sensitive data"
---
- headsets will have access to extremely sensitive biological data
	- wearer's facial expressions, eye retina, muscle contractions, sweat
- from people's reaction to given sensations (ie. how retina dilates when certain advertisement is seen), very precise behavioural data can be computed
- these data need to be extremely protected
	- malicious actors can impersonate anyone
	- malicious socials could use these "almost-perfect" behaviour models for [[Mass manipulation]]
- Meta is already granted patents for predicting user's body movement and facial expressions [source](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-meta-patents-show-vision-for-hyperrealistic-metaverse-2022-1)
