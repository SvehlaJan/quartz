title: "Governance, policies"
---
- various systems in Metaverse will need to have some policies and governance
- will it be centralised (decisions done only by the the owning company) or decentralised?
	- what if the company decides to change the rules, damaging the users?
- many web3 projects claim to solve this problem by giving ownership rights to all stakeholders (ie. everyone who owns tokens of given project can vote)
	- in many cases, majority of tokens/voting rights is owned by a small group with common interests (ie. founders with investors)
- ownership distribution doesn't guarantee distributed decisions (Zuckerberg owns ~17% of stocks but ~58% of voting shares)
- [[DAO]] might improve the situation
