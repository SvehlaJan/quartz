title: "Brainstorming notes"
---
- share the data before the brainstorming

- what is the problem? what do we know about it?
- what is actually being done to solve the problem? (existing projects)
- what will be the benefit for the user? (projected, hypothetical)
- what will be the benefit for Avast? are we strong in the area? would we need external help?
- hypothetical risks?
- ideas?





High Level Agenda

-   30min - Metaverse topic walkthrough (15x2 - 40min);
- discussion with goal of selecting the most interesting areas
- split to groups, they will work on selected areas, fill in a template ^
- present the findings, the filled in template
- choose one and try idea generation (if we have time or leave it for separate session)
